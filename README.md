Arduino Uno With Optocoupler Relay is a board based on ATmega328p which is an 8-bit microcontroller from ATMEL. The main purpose of building this board is to use it in COVID-19 and similar kinds of projects. It consists of two relays with optocoupler protection. Also, it has a provision to connect the ultrasonic sensor and use it for further application. There is a push-button on-board as well to perform reset.
